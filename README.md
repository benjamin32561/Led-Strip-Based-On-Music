Music Reactive LED Strip
========================

Introduction
------------

The Music Reactive LED Strip is an innovative project that combines the power of C/C++ programming with hardware interfacing to create a dynamic LED lighting experience. Utilizing an ESP microcontroller, this project allows for an LED strip to be controlled via Bluetooth. The core functionality lies in its ability to receive audio data through the A2DP protocol and manipulate the LED brightness in response to the bass volume. This effect is achieved by analyzing the audio data using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms, creating a synchronized light show that matches the rhythm and intensity of the music.

Features
--------

*   Bluetooth connectivity using A2DP protocol.
*   Real-time audio data analysis with FFT.
*   Dynamic LED brightness control based on bass volume.
*   Easy to set up and customizable.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

*   ESP microcontroller (model specifics)
*   LED strip compatible with ESP
*   Bluetooth module (if not integrated into the ESP)
*   Power supply for LED strip and ESP

Software Requirements
---------------------

*   C/C++ programming environment
*   Libraries for FFT analysis
*   ESP Bluetooth libraries

Installation
------------

1.  Set up your C/C++ development environment.
